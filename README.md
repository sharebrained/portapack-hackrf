# portapack-hackrf

_NOTE:_ This original firmware for the PortaPack H1 was forked into the [Mayhem project](https://github.com/eried/portapack-mayhem), which is now far more interesting and active. I recommend you use that firmware for all your PortaPacking needs. This repository is hereby archived.

The PortaPack H1 makes the [HackRF One software-defined radio](http://greatscottgadgets.com/hackrf/) portable. It adds an LCD touchscreen, user interface navigation controls, audio output and input, micro SD card slot, 2.5 PPM crystal oscillator, and real-time clock battery backup. The PortaPack firmware provides a user interface and necessary signal processing to do many useful things without a computer.

Visit the [wiki](https://github.com/sharebrained/portapack-hackrf/wiki) for more details.

Hardware was once available from [ShareBrained Technology](http://sharebrained.com/). But now there are many manufacturers, vendors, and variations of this open-source hardware. I have not used any of them myself, so can't offer any specific recommendations.
